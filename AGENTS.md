# AGENTS.md

Read [PRINCIPLES.md](./PRINCIPLES.md) before making any architectural or implementation decisions. Every contribution must align with these principles — if it doesn't, fix the design, not the principles.

## Service lifecycle

Sovereign runs under a supervisor (a systemd user unit, `sovereign.service`, on Linux). `bin/sovereign` drives it: `build`, `status`, `start`, `stop`, `restart`, `logs`, `health`. Production serves the compiled `packages/server/dist/index.js`, so source edits change nothing until `bin/sovereign build` runs.

Never signal the server pid directly. Use `bin/sovereign restart` or the supervisor's own restart command — a direct kill leaves the supervisor's view of the process stale, which is the first step of the failure below.

### Shutdown must call `process.exit()`

`packages/server/src/index.ts` handles SIGINT and SIGTERM. Registering those listeners overrides Node's default terminate-on-signal, so the handler **must** exit explicitly. Sovereign always holds open handles (agent-backend subprocesses, websockets, intervals), so without an explicit exit the process cleans up and then keeps running.

The observed failure chain, if that exit is missing:

1. The supervisor sends SIGINT; the process shuts down but survives.
2. The supervisor loses track of it; the process re-parents to init while still holding `.sovereign.lock` and the server port.
3. Each replacement start correctly refuses to boot on the held lock.
4. With unlimited restarts, this loops silently and indefinitely (observed 2026-08-01: 41,901 restarts across 58 hours).

### Required supervisor directives

- **A start rate limit** (`StartLimitIntervalSec` + `StartLimitBurst`). Without it, a persistent start failure retries forever and stays invisible. With it, the unit lands in `failed`, where a status check surfaces it immediately.
- **`KillSignal=SIGINT`** — the server's graceful path.
- **`TimeoutStopSec`** of ~30s. Shutdown only flushes to disk and closes streams. In-flight LLM turns are severed deliberately; the resume orchestrator picks them up on the next boot.
- **`Restart=on-failure`**, paired with the start rate limit above.

### Single-instance lock

`packages/server/src/lockfile.ts` holds the policy; `.sovereign.lock` lives in the data dir. Two invariants, both covered by `lockfile.test.ts`:

- A live lock holder that is **not** a Sovereign process never blocks a boot. Pids get recycled, and a false positive wedges the service permanently.
- `release()` only unlinks a lock the calling process owns. An instance that loses the race and exits must not disarm the guard for the winner.

The lock is a diagnostic aid, not the only guard — the port bind fails independently if two instances ever race. The server also re-checks lock ownership every 30s and logs loudly if the lock vanishes or changes hands, because a disarmed guard is otherwise completely silent.

### Only one unit may manage the service

`bin/sovereign` drives the **user-scope** unit (`systemctl --user`). A system-scope unit of the same name is a duplicate, and duplicates are destructive here: on 2026-08-01 a leftover `/etc/systemd/system/sovereign.service` was still `enabled`, crash-looping every ~11s on `EADDRINUSE`, and carried

    ExecStartPre=/bin/rm -f .../.sovereign.lock

so it deleted the healthy instance's lock roughly five times a minute. Never write an `ExecStartPre` that removes the lock — that defeats the guard by design, and it converts a clean "refusing to boot" into an instance race.

To audit both scopes:

    systemctl --user status sovereign.service
    systemctl status sovereign.service        # must not exist / must be disabled

## Rebuild semantics

A rebuild severs in-flight agent turns rather than draining them. Draining deadlocks whenever the rebuild is triggered from inside an in-flight session, which is the common case. Recovery is `packages/agent-backend/src/resume.ts`, which runs at boot over `active-sessions.json`:

- **Tier 1** — replay the in-flight message-queue head.
- **Tier 2** — drop the entry when the assistant turn actually completed before shutdown; invalidate when the backend session file has gone.
- **Tier 3** — synthesize a continuation message, quoting the in-flight prompt. Always-on: the backend's session resume rehydrates a transcript and then waits for input, so a mid-turn session otherwise sits idle forever.
- **tool-await** — a `PreToolUse` hook was holding the backend open (currently `AskUserQuestion`). The backend re-fires the tool on resume, so synthesizing a continuation here would duplicate it. Short-circuit instead.

## Presence system

Two long-lived threads form the presence system (`packages/presence/`):

- **`presence-internal`** (`ThreadInfo.presence = 'internal'`) — the agent's stream-of-consciousness. Receives ambient inbound (voice, AD4M, watched-thread digests). The agent speaks externally only via `presence_reply_*` tool calls; silence counts as valid. Carries PRESENCE.md + PRESENCE_MEMORY.md + PRESENCE_KNOWLEDGE.md in its session prompt.
- **`presence`** (`ThreadInfo.presence = 'gateway'`) — the user's text-chat surface. A normal Claude Code thread. Carries only PRESENCE_KNOWLEDGE.md in its session prompt.

### Prompt layers

`makePresenceAwareAppendResolver` in `packages/agent-backend/src/wiring.ts` controls injection. The internal thread receives personality + memory + knowledge; the gateway thread receives knowledge only; all other threads receive nothing from the presence layer.

### Knowledge graph (AD4M perspective)

Both presence threads maintain a shared knowledge graph in a private AD4M perspective named `hex-knowledge`. The schema, tools, and patterns live in `~/.sovereign/PRESENCE_KNOWLEDGE.md` (injected into both sessions). Two subject classes:

- **Entity** (`hex://Entity`) — durable nodes (person, project, concept, system)
- **Note** (`hex://Note`) — timestamped knowledge units (observation, decision, fact, preference, insight)

Relationships between entities use raw AD4M links under `hex://` predicates. The agent bootstraps the perspective + models on first session activation via `mcp__ad4m__*` tools.

## Tests

The root `vitest.config.ts` collects `packages/*/src/**/*.test.ts`. Most packages have no local vitest config, so `pnpm --filter <pkg> test` reports "no test files" for them — that is expected. The repo-root run is the real gate.
