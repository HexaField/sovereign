# Template Monorepo

This is a modern, full-stack TypeScript monorepo template managed with **pnpm workspaces**. It provides a pre-configured environment for building scalable applications with a shared core library, a SolidJS client, and an Express server.

## 📂 Project Structure

The monorepo is organized into the following packages:

- **`packages/client`**: A frontend application built with **SolidJS**, **Vite**, and **Tailwind CSS**. It includes **Storybook** for component development and **Playwright** for end-to-end testing.
- **`packages/server`**: A backend server built with **Express**. It uses **tsx** for fast development execution.
- **`packages/core`**: A shared library containing common logic, types, or utilities used by both the client and server. It is bundled using **Rollup**.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (Latest LTS recommended)
- **pnpm** (Package manager)

### Installation

Install all dependencies across the monorepo:

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Development

Start the development servers for both the client and server concurrently:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

- **Client**: http://localhost:5173 (default Vite port)
- **Server**: Check console output for port (typically configured in `src/index.ts`)

## 🛠 Scripts

Run these scripts from the root directory:

| Script         | Description                                                |
| :------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pnpm dev`     | Starts client and server in development mode concurrently. |
| `pnpm build`   | Builds all packages in the workspace.                      |
| `pnpm test`    | Runs tests across all packages (Vitest & Playwright).      |
| `pnpm lint`    | Lints code using Oxlint.                                   |
| `pnpm format`  | Formats code using Oxfmt.                                  |
| `pnpm check`   | Runs type checking (`tsc`) and linting.                    |
| `pnpm prepare` | Sets up Husky git hooks.                                   |
